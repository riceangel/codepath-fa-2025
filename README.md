# codepath-fa-2025
Code for my project for Codepath's WEB101 Introduction to Web Development course!

Students are tasked with creating a website for an event. My website highlights the Intermission Orchestra at Berkeley's upcoming December 2025 concert and features a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. 

The class is currently ongoing and will end in late November 2025. Future features throughout the course will include event implementation, an HTML form with validation, and JavaScript animations, so stay tuned!
